# Creating-a-Burger-Company-Simulation
This Burger Company Simulation is created using basic concepts of OOP's.
The purpose of the application is to help a fictitious company called Bills Burgers to manage their process of selling hamburgers.
Our application will help Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions) to be added to the burgers and pricing.
We want to create a base hamburger, but also two other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in Bills store.
The basic hamburger should have the following items.
    Bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc) that the customer can select to be       added to the burger.
Each one of these items gets charged an additional price so you need some way to track how many items got added and to calculate the final price (base burger with all the additions). This burger has a base price and the additions are all separately priced (up to 4 additions, see above).Also create two extra varieties of Hamburgers to cater for
    a) Healthy burger (on a brown rye bread roll), plus two addition items that can be added. The healthy burger can have 6 items                 (Additions) in total.
    b) Deluxe hamburger - comes with chips and drinks as additions, but no extra additions are allowed.
 All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger, plus all additional's, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand/final total for the, burger (base price + all additions).
